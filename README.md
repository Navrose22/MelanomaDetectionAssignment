# Melanoma Detection Assignment
> The aim is to build an automated classification system based on image processing techniques to classify skin cancer using skin lesions images.

## Why Melanoma is a Serious Problem?
As ozone levels are depleted, the atmosphere loses more and more of its protective filter function and more solar UV radiation reaches the Earth's surface. It is estimated that a 10 per cent decrease in ozone levels will result in an additional  4,500 melanoma skin cancer cases. The global incidence of melanoma continues to increase â€“ however, the main factors that predispose to the development of melanoma seem to be connected with recreational exposure to the sun and a history of sunburn. These factors lie within each individual's own responsibility.

## Problem Statement
Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Motivation
The overarching goal is to support the efforts to reduce the death caused by skin cancer. The primary motivation that drives the project is to use the advanced image classification technology for the well-being of the people. Computer vision has made good progress in machine learning and deep learning that are scalable across domains.

## DataSet
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

The data set contains the following diseases:

- Actinic keratosis
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Dermatofibroma
- Melanoma
- Nevus
- Pigmented benign keratosis
- Seborrheic keratosis
- Squamous cell carcinoma
- Vascular lesion

## CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks)
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep neural network specifically designed for processing structured grid data, such as images. CNNs are widely used in computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.


## CNN Architecture Design
To classify skin cancer using skin lesions images. To achieve higher accuracy and results on the classification task, I have built custom CNN model.

- Rescalling Layer - To rescale an input in the [0, 255] range to be in the [0, 1] range.
- Convolutional Layer - Convolutional layers apply a convolution operation to the input, passing the result to the next layer. A convolution converts all the pixels in its receptive field into a single value. For example, if you would apply a convolution to an image, you will be decreasing the image size as well as bringing all the information in the field together into a single pixel.
- Pooling Layer - Pooling layers are used to reduce the dimensions of the feature maps. Thus, it reduces the number of parameters to learn and the amount of computation performed in the network. The pooling layer summarises the features present in a region of the feature map generated by a convolution layer.
- Dropout Layer - The Dropout layer randomly sets input units to 0 with a frequency of rate at each step during training time, which helps prevent overfitting.
- Flatten Layer - Flattening is converting the data into a 1-dimensional array for inputting it to the next layer. We flatten the output of the convolutional layers to create a single long feature vector. And it is connected to the final classification model, which is called a fully-connected layer.
- Dense Layer - The dense layer is a neural network layer that is connected deeply, which means each neuron in the dense layer receives input from all neurons of its previous layer.
- Activation Function(ReLU) - The rectified linear activation function or ReLU for short is a piecewise linear function that will output the input directly if it is positive, otherwise, it will output zero.The rectified linear activation function overcomes the vanishing gradient problem, allowing models to learn faster and perform better.
- Activation Function(Softmax) - The softmax function is used as the activation function in the output layer of neural network models that predict a multinomial probability distribution. The main advantage of using Softmax is the output probabilities range. The range will 0 to 1, and the sum of all the probabilities will be equal to one.

## Melanoma Detection using Custom CNN Models
Melanoma detection involves identifying malignant skin lesions, and CNNs can be effective tools for this task due to their ability to learn hierarchical features from images. Here's a general approach to using custom CNN models for melanoma detection:
- Dataset Preparation:
Collect a dataset of skin images, including both melanoma and non-melanoma (benign) samples. Ensure that the dataset is diverse and representative of the real-world scenarios.

- Data Preprocessing:
Preprocess the images, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation. Normalization ensures that pixel values are in a consistent range, and augmentation helps the model generalize better by introducing variations like rotation and flipping.

- Model Architecture:
Design a custom CNN architecture suitable for the melanoma detection task. The architecture might include convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for downsampling, and fully connected layers for making predictions. Consider using dropout or batch normalization to prevent overfitting.

- Training:
Split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Train the model on the training set, using the validation set to monitor performance and prevent overfitting. Choose appropriate loss functions (e.g., binary cross-entropy for binary classification) and optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam).

- Evaluation:
Evaluate the trained model on the test set to assess its performance. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are commonly used for binary classification tasks.

- Fine-Tuning:
Fine-tune the model if necessary. This may involve adjusting hyperparameters, modifying the architecture, or retraining on additional data.

- Deployment:
Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it for melanoma detection in real-world scenarios. This could involve integrating it into a web or mobile application or using it in a healthcare setting.
